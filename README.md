# RunToSurvive-Game
Run To Survive is a 2D endless runner game developed in Python using the Pygame library, built with an object-oriented programming (OOP) structure. The player controls a character running continuously forward, trying to avoid randomly appearing obstacles and achieve the highest possible score.

The project includes:

- classes responsible for the player, obstacles, game logic, and user interface,

- collision detection and 2D motion physics,
  
- a scoring system and game state screens (start, gameplay, game over),

- random obstacle generation during gameplay.

Technologies used: Python 3 (pygame, sys)
